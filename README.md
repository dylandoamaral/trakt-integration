## Recomendations 💡

Having the following installed in Home Assistant will help best use this integration:

- [Upcoming Media Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card)

## Installation 🏠

Installation is a multi-step process. Follow each of the following steps.

### 1. Add HACS Integration

This integration is available in [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store). Install it as follows:

- In Home Assistant, go to HACS > Integrations
- Press the **Explore & Add Repositories** button
- Search for "Trakt"
  - Note: There are two Trakt integrations.
    Choose the one with the description "A Trakt integration for Home Assistant compatible with upcoming media card".
    See [Why not use sensor.trakt?](#why-not-use-sensortrakt-)
- Press the **Install this repository in HACS** button
- Press the **Install** button

### 2. Update Configuration File

The following shows all of the integration's default settings.
Add it as a top-level key (i.e., `trakt_tv:` is not indented) in the `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
trakt_tv:
  language: en # Prefered language for movie/show title
  timezone: Europe/Paris # Prefered timezone
  sensors:
    upcoming:
      show:
        days_to_fetch: 90 # How many days in the future you want to fetch
        max_medias: 3 # How many medias you want to fetch
      new_show:
        days_to_fetch: 90
        max_medias: 3
      premiere:
        days_to_fetch: 90
        max_medias: 3
      movie:
        days_to_fetch: 90
        max_medias: 3
      dvd:
        days_to_fetch: 90
        max_medias: 3
    next_to_watch:
      show:
        max_medias: 40
        exclude:
          - veep
          - the-original
          - friends
```

#### Integration Settings

- `language` should be an [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (default is "en")
- `timezone` should be a [pytz timezone](https://gist.github.com/heyalexej/8bf688fd67d7199be4a1682b3eec7568) (default is the server timezone)

#### Available Sensors

By default, this integration does not create any sensors.
The settings that you include in the `configuration.yaml` file determines which sensors are created.
This keeps you from having useless sensors that you don't need, such as the DVD sensor which will likely not fetch anything from the Trakt API,
but you can still use it if you want to.

##### Upcoming sensors

Upcoming sensors are sensors giving the next anticipated movies or shows from your watch list.

There are five sensors available under the `sensors` > `upcoming` array:

- `show` for [TV Shows](https://trakt.tv/calendars/my/shows/) (actually, episodes). Creates `sensor.trakt_upcoming_shows`
- `new_show` for [New Shows](https://trakt.tv/calendars/my/new-shows/) (series premiers). Creates `sensor.trakt_upcoming_new_shows`
- `premiere` for [Season Premieres](https://trakt.tv/calendars/my/premieres/). Creates `sensor.trakt_upcoming_premieres`
- `movie` for [Movies](https://trakt.tv/calendars/my/movies/) premieres. Creates `sensor.trakt_upcoming_movies`
- `dvd` for [DVD & Blu-ray](https://trakt.tv/calendars/my/dvd/) releases. Creates `sensor.trakt_upcoming_dvds`

There are two parameters for each sensor:

- `days_to_fetch` should be a positive number for how many days to search
- `max_medias` should be a positive number for how many items to grab

##### All Upcoming sensors

All Upcoming sensors are sensors giving the next anticipated movies or shows.

There are five sensors available under the `sensors` > `all_upcoming` array:

- `show` for [TV Shows](https://trakt.tv/calendars/all/shows/) (actually, episodes). Creates `sensor.trakt_all_upcoming_shows`
- `new_show` for [New Shows](https://trakt.tv/calendars/all/new-shows/) (series premiers). Creates `sensor.trakt_all_upcoming_new_shows`
- `premiere` for [Season Premieres](https://trakt.tv/calendars/all/premieres/). Creates `sensor.trakt_all_upcoming_premieres`
- `movie` for [Movies](https://trakt.tv/calendars/all/movies/) premieres. Creates `sensor.trakt_all_upcoming_movies`
- `dvd` for [DVD & Blu-ray](https://trakt.tv/calendars/all/dvd/) releases. Creates `sensor.trakt_all_upcoming_dvds`

There are two parameters for each sensor:

- `days_to_fetch` should be a positive number for how many days to search
- `max_medias` should be a positive number for how many items to grab

##### Recommendation sensors

Recommendation sensors are sensors giving media that you may like.

There are five sensors available under the `sensors` > `recommendation` array:

- `show` for TV Shows. Creates `sensor.trakt_recommendation_shows`
- `movie` for Movies. Creates `sensor.trakt_recommendation_movies`

There are one parameter for each sensor:

- `max_medias` should be a positive number for how many items to grab

##### Next To Watch sensor

Next To Watch sensor is sensor giving the next show to watch depending on your progress.

There only one sensor available under the `sensors` > `next_to_watch` array:

- `show` for [TV Shows progress](https://trakt.tv/users/<username>/progress) (actually, episodes). Creates `sensor.trakt_next_to_watch_shows`

There are two parameters for each sensor:

- `max_medias` should be a positive number for how many items to grab
- `exclude` should be a list of shows you'd like to exclude, since it's based on your watched history. To find keys to put there, go on trakt.tv, search for a show, click on it, notice the url slug, copy/paste it. So, if I want to hide "Friends", I'll do the steps mentioned above, then land on https://trakt.tv/shows/friends, I'll just have to copy/paste the last part, `friends`, that's it

#### Example

For example, adding only the following to `configuration.yaml` will create two sensors.
One with the next 10 TV episodes in the next 30 days and another with the next 5 movies coming out in the next 45 days:

```yaml
trakt_tv:
  language: en
  sensors:
    upcoming:
      show:
        days_to_fetch: 30
        max_medias: 10
      movie:
        days_to_fetch: 45
        max_medias: 5
    recommendation:
      show:
        max_medias: 3
      movie:
        max_medias: 3
```

### 3. Restart Home Assistant

- Confirm the `configuration.yaml` is valid in Configuration > Server Controls > Configuration validation > **Check Configuration** button
- Restart your Home Assistant server in Configuration > Server Controls > Server management > **Restart** button

Note: You will not see anything new in Home Assistant yet.

### 4. Prepare Trakt

You have to provide a `client_id` and a `client_secret` to use this integration. Get these keys with the following:

- Go to the [Trakt API Apps](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) page and press the **New application** button
- Fill in the **Name** (required) and **Description** (optional) fields. These fields are just for your own reference
- Fill in **Redirect uri** with one of the following
  - If you use HA Cloud: `https://<ha-cloud-remote-url>/auth/external/callback`
  - If you do not use HA Cloud: `https://<your-ha-server-address>:<port>/auth/external/callback`
- Do not enter anything in **Javascript (cors) origins** and do not select any **Permissions**
- Press the **Save app** button
- Record the displayed `client_id` and `client_secret`
  - Note: You do not need to press the **Authorize** button!

### 5. Add Home Assistant Integration

- In Home Assistant, go to Configuration > Integrations
- Press the **Add Integration** button
- Search for "Trakt" and click on it
- Enter the `client_id` and `client_secret` from Trakt
- Press the **Submit** button
- Press the **Finish** button

Depending on the options you set in the `configuration.yaml` file, the sensors may take a while to be created and populated.

### 6. Add an Upcoming Media Card

Go to your Dashboard, enable editing, and add a manual card like the following:

```yaml
type: custom:upcoming-media-card
entity: sensor.trakt_upcoming_shows
title: Upcoming Episodes
image_style: fanart
hide_empty: true
title_text: $title
line1_text: $episode
line2_text: $number
line3_text: $day, $date $time
line4_text: $empty
max: 10
```

See the [Upcoming Media Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/upcoming-media-card) page for formatting and display options to add to your card.

## Workaround

Some people are unable to use the integration because the OAUTH authentification is not working.

Thanks @blizzrdof77 and @robloh for the following workaround:

1. go to https://my.home-assistant.io/ and enter the correct path to my instance (example: http://172.30.1.11:8123/)
2. instead of entering your local address (http://172.30.1.11:8123/) in the TRAKT application page, enter this: https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth
3. add the integration
4. accept in TRAKT
5. then accept in the my home assistant page that showed up
6. profit

## Additional Information ℹ️

### Why not use sensor.trakt ?

There is already another integration for Trakt, [sensor.trakt](https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.trakt). However, I decided to create my own integration for the following reasons:

- The other integration is almost never updated
- They haven't accepted my [pull request](https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.trakt/pull/58) for more than 3 months, so I modified it in my local environment to meet my needs
- This integration provides more features than the old one
  - Fetch more than 33 days (the single-query limitation on Trakt)
  - Have both the Movies and TV Shows calendars at the same time
  - Use other Trakt calendars such as Premieres, New Shows, and DVD & Blu-ray releases
